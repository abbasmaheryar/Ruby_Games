# Ruby_Games
Hello everyone! This is an open source repository that anyone can donwload to access ruby games created by other developers.

### How to commit

You will need to know at the minimum of Ruby, and other gems. Your commitments will be evaluated and judged. You can simply fork this repository and add a game that you think would best fit the community. After that, create a pull request to submit your game.

### Launching Games

To launch the games, you will need to have ruby installed. Then, go to the correct directory the folder is in and run the following command:

```
ruby {game_name}.rb
```

Alternatively, if you are a mac user, you can run the launcher.command file and load games from there. A windows batch file will be availible soon.
